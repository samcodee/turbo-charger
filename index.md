### WHY IS **_TURBO CHARGER_**, **_CARCLUB_** AND **_CAR_** ARE CREATED?
To understand that, you need to first understand what is **_CARCLUB_**. Carclub is a team created by four students. In the team, each team member will bring some facts or information about cars. Thus, the name Carclub. You might think why we done a website for this small thing but, we done this to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Then we wanted to open the site to worldwide. So, we wanted a domain. that's where GITHUB comes into play. We created a repository in Github and hosted our wesite. One such website is Turbo-charger.
