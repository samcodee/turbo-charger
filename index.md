**_TURBO CHARGER_** is an another version of **_[CARCLUB](https://samcodee.github.io/carclub/)_**. It is the third version **_CARCLUB_**. The second version of **_CARCLUB_** is **_[CAR](https://samcodee.github.io/car/)_**.

### WHY WAS **_TURBO CHARGER_**, **_CARCLUB_** AND **_CAR_** ARE CREATED?
To understand that, you need to first understand what is **_CARCLUB_**. Carclub is a team created by four students. In the team, each team member will bring some facts or information about cars. Thus, the name Carclub. You might think why we done a website for this small thing but, we done this to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Then we wanted to open the site to worldwide. So, we wanted a domain. that's where GITHUB comes into play. We created a repository in Github and hosted our wesite. One such website is Turbo-charger.

### Tesla Model X
Since its release, the Tesla Model X has been subject to a series of updates in its software and hardware.

Here are 7 interesting facts about this cutting edge vehicle;

It pioneered as the first all-electric SUV and was released as the second vehicle from Tesla’s second generation platform.

Initially, Tesla has shipped a few thousand Model X SUVs with 6 and 7-seat configuration. However, recent reports have revealed that Tesla is set to introduce a 5-seat configuration. The company proudly claims it to be the best-in-class vehicle that is equipped with a second row bench seat that folds flat for this 5-seat configuration. The interior cargo storage opens up to 88 cubic feet and is designed with a 60/40 split to recline separately, or fold down entirely flat for additional cargo space. tesla model x white side

Although it is not recommended, the Tesla Model X could tow up to 3,500 pounds on 22” wheels. When outfitted with 20” wheels, the Tesla X towing capacity can increase to 5,000 pounds.

With its Falcon wing doors, the company realized the impracticality with regards to storing outdoor equipment, like skis and snowboards. Tesla designed a way for the owner to conveniently stow their skis and snowboards on the exterior of their model X. The ski and snowboard carrier can be easily assembled and now allows a lockable storage with soft rubber coated arms that secure equipment and reduce the risk of scratching the surface of either the stowed equipment or the vehicle itself. The carrier can accommodate up to 6 pairs of skis or 4 snowboards.

Ever since it has received the Golden Steering Wheel Award in 2016, the company made efforts to focus on all the software and hardware improvements done on Tesla Model X. The Falcon wing door underwent 2 improvements in its door sensor object detector. It also had a 25% improvement in the opening/closing speed. Moreover, its dynamic profile adjustment enables the indoor mode with roof sensor to detect low ceiling. The powered front doors and remote keyless entry were also given attention. The keyfob detection was refined for improved smart automatic front door behavior as you enter, approach, or leave the car.Its keyfob battery life was also improved 8 times with an automated alert from the car if the battery gets low. 51% of door issues were reduced as several improvements were made to power front door movement and latching system with enhanced performance on steep inclines. Customer reports regarding wind noise issues were also reduced by 22%. Through introducing Cabin Overheat Protection, the maximum interior temperature of Model X is more easily managed. The HVAC performance was also improved by increasing the maximum fan speed with an over-the-air software update. The seat motion, obstacle detection, pitch calibration, and usability of second row seats were enhanced through multiple over-the-air updates. Intelligent behaviours between seats were also added through software enhancements. Over-the-air software updates had also improved the vehicle’s touchscreen, graphical user interface, and Bluetooth connectivity with Tesla’s 8.0 software rollout.

Unplugged Performance gave a gushing review of the Tesla X. On their website, they praised the improvements done on the new front fascia, side skirt set, rear bumper, and deck-lid spoiler which made the Model X look sportier. They consider the Tesla Model X as an “amazing feat of engineering” as it enabled seven passengers to ride in the car through its unique design. modelx_white_wall_2x

Its smart software even allows users to adjust vehicle height for better handling, efficiency and ride comfort. Through the touchscreen, the user can raise or lower their Tesla Model X when it enters a driveway, navigates through snow, or unloads passengers and belonging

### Koenisegg Agera
You might have heard about the new Koenigsegg Agera RS breaking the Bugatti’s 0-400kph record. Well, the Koenigsegg Agera RS has now been recognized as the fastest production car ever designed. It has averaged 277.9mph in 2 ways in order to counteract the impact of gravity and wind. The Koenigsegg Agera RS was able to prove itself after the Swedish carmaker was able to conquer the 11-mile stretch of Route 160 in Nevada. The results were fascinating, as it was able to break the top speed record of production cars, such as the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport at 265.7mph back in 2010.

Here are 5 interesting facts to get to know more about this Swedish speedy car.

It utilizes advanced technology developed at the Koenigseegg One:1 program. It also features a luggage compartment and detachable hardtop that you can stow inside for top-down motoring.

It has advanced lightweight sound insulation, front winglets, all-new front splitter optimized for the tracks, advanced dynamic underbody flap system, side skirts, and active rear spoiler for more down force.

Advanced layup and composites techniques developed during the One:1 program. This would lower the curb weight in comparison with the Agera S and R models.

It also provides the choice for Koenigsegg active and self-leveling chassis package, alternative aero package, 3G connected Pre-Active chassis setups, and sound cancellation, among others.

The previous Agera S engine has been improved for regular pump gas, putting 1160bph with the regular petrol. This should be at a shocking 232bhp per liter with great reliability.

The Agera RS can be configured to run on E85 in certain markets for higher power levels. However, it can be adjusted on-the-fly to any fuel mix with its engine management system at any time.

Overall, the Koenigsegg Agera RS has an ultimate track and road versatility. In fact, you may test drive it to do the most extreme performance without worrying about road ordinance. This is because the Koenigsegg Agera RS complies with the safety standards as well as other homologation requirements around the world.

### Lamborghini Veneno
The Lamborghini Veneno (Spanish pronunciation: [beˈneno]) is a limited production high performance sports car manufactured by Italian automobile manufacturer Lamborghini. Based on the Lamborghini Aventador, the Veneno was developed to celebrate Lamborghini’s 50th anniversary. It was introduced at the 2013 Geneva Motor Show. When introduced, it had a price of US$4,000,000, making it one of the most expensive production cars in the world.

The prototype, Car Zero, is finished in Grigio Telesto (medium grey) and includes an Italian flag vinyl on both sides of the car.

#### Rear view
The engine is a development of the Aventador’s 6.5-litre V12 and generates a power output of 750 PS (552 kW; 740 hp) at 8,400 rpm and 690 N⋅m (509 lb⋅ft) of torque at 5,500 rpm. The increase in power was achieved by enlarging the air intakes and modifying the exhaust system.

The Veneno is Lamborghini’s interpretation of a racing prototype built for the road. The front of the car is designed for maximum airflow and for improved downforce. The redesigned front and rear arches direct air around the car in order to reduce excessive lift and aid in generating downforce. The smooth underbody ensures that the airflow is not interrupted. The large carbon-fibre rear wing connected to the car via an LMP-style central fin is three-way adjustable. The wheels of the car (measuring 20-inch at the front and 21-inch at the rear) have a turbine-like design and direct air to cool the car’s carbon ceramic braking system. The center lock wheels allow for easy installation and removal. The car utilises Pirelli P-Zero tyres.

The Veneno retains the carbon-fibre monocoque chassis with aluminium front and rear subframe from the Aventador along with the pushrod suspension system. The interior is based largely on the Aventador’s interior, but now incorporates the “carbon skin” element introduced on the Aventador J. The 7-speed ISR semi-automatic transmission is also retained from the Aventador and includes a new “track” setting for improved performance on a race track.

#### Design
The rear wheel arches are inspired by the Lamborghini Countach and the turbine wheels help to cool the brakes The design of the Veneno is a large departure from the previous styling of Lamborghini models. The design is inspired by Sports prototypes and racing cars. The Y-shaped design elements are a carryover from the Aventador’s design language while the rear wheel arches hark back to the Countach. The vented engine cover improves cooling to the engine, while the extreme aerodynamic elements present on the car signify its track-focused characteristics.

#### Performance
The Lamborghini Veneno has a top speed of 356 km/h (221 mph) and has a 0–97 km/h (0–60 mph) acceleration time of 2.8 seconds. The car has a braking distance of 30 m (98.0 ft) from 97–0 km/h (60–0 mph), and can produce 1.41 G while cornering.

#### Veneno Roadster
The roadster variant of the Lamborghini Veneno was unveiled on the Italian naval aircraft carrier Cavour docked in Abu Dhabi’s Mina Zayed port in 2014,[7][8] followed by the 2014 Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show.[9] Performance of the roadster remains identical to that of the coupé with the roadster being 50 kg (110.2 lb) heavier than the coupé counterpart due to chassis reinforcing components. The roadster went on sale for €3,300,000 (excluding tax). Only nine units of the roadster were produced, all of which were already sold.

#### Production
Lamborghini built just five examples of the Veneno: one for factory testing (dubbed car number zero), one retained for the factory, and three cars for customers, all of which were customised to customer specifications.

### Tesla model 3 performance
Tesla Model 3 is the all-electric entry-level sedan from Tesla Inc. and we decode why Tesla Model 3 managed to attract such high number of buyers and why is it so special?

If you are a fan of Marvel’s Iron Man in reel-life, you have to know about Elon Musk, the real-life Iron Man. While it’s not appropriate to draw parallels between an imaginary comic character and a real-life human, you just can’t ignore the similarities between the two. Both of them have worked towards the advancement of science and keep on bringing new technologies, which are much ahead of their time. Musk is currently at the helm of three companies that include Paypal, Tesla Inc. (formerly known as Tesla Motors), and SpaceX.

We are more interested towards the Tesla Inc., a company that pioneers in manufacturing all-electric luxury cars. Today, Tesla Inc. is valued more than some of the biggest names in the automotive industry and that’s not bad at all, given that Tesla Motors is just over a decade old. Tesla Motors has already given us cars like the Model S luxury sedan and Model X luxury crossover. But it was the announcement of the Tesla Model 3 that took the electric-car game to a whole new level. Let us decode why Tesla Model 3 managed to attract such high number of buyers and why is it so special?

#### Budget Sedan
Elon Musk has been very clear about the positioning of his brand’s cars in the market. Tesla sells only luxury all-electric cars and not budget cars. So when Tesla announced the entry-level Model 3, the market got berserk. Tesla priced the Model 3 for $35000 (base model) and within no time, received 1 lakh+ bookings. As of now, total bookings stand at 2 lakh cars. That’s a huge number by any means and going by the current rate, it will take at least 3 years to complete the current orders delivery. And that too when we are not counting the ongoing bookings. Tesla had to build a new Gigafactory just to cater the battery supply for the Model 3.

#### Range
Any electric car has that essential mileage issue, given the limited infrastructure to charge the electric cars. Simply put, you can refill your gasoline car if it runs dry, but the chances of charging your electric car in case of dried up batteries would be immensely low. Tesla, on the other hand, promises to be a game changer here. Elon Musk has promised that the new Model 3 will have a mileage of 215 miles (350 kms) for the base version. Get yourself a higher variant with a bigger battery and you will get an all-electric range of 300 miles (480 kms). That’s a highly respectable number for any electric car in the market today, and this is what gives the Tesla cars an edge over the other electric car manufacturers.

#### Acceleration
A fast electric car is a rare breed. We have an exception of the Formula E championship, but then those cars use extremely expensive technology, that can’t be replicated in a mass-produced car. Because a fast electric car will drain the battery too fast, leaving you searching for charging stations. But the Tesla cars are a different league altogether. The new Model 3 promises to run 0-100 kmph in 5.7 seconds. It has a Ludacris mode too, that will push the Model 3 from standstill to 100 in under 3 seconds.

#### Autopilot mode
Believe it or not, autonomous driving is a part of today’s cars and the autonomous cars will soon be part of our daily transport system. Tesla’s Autopilot is arguably the most advanced autonomous-driving system available today. And the Tesla Model 3 will come equipped with this high-tech Autopilot system which relies on eight cameras providing 360-degree visibility around the car. It has a 250-metre range and also 12 ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles, other vehicles and even pedestrians. Tesla is working to make this system, still, it’s the best system yet. Tesla provide yearly updates to the system that can be downloaded into each and every Tesla car’s brain; irrespective of their model year.

#### India Launch
The coolest thing, though, is that the Model 3 will mark the Tesla’s debut in India. We are not sure when and how it will happen, but Elon Musk is in talks with the government to set up a base in the country. Also, given the price of the international spec model, Indian model could very well be priced close to Rs 35 Lakhs, making it a worthy buy in this price range.
